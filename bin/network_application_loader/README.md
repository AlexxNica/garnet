# Network Application Loader

This app loader loads a VMO from a network URL for use with ApplicationRunner.
It is wired into the app loading process by Modular bootstrap. See
[//garnet/bin/bootstrap/loaders.config](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/garnet/+/master/bin/bootstrap/loaders.config)
for scheme mappings.
