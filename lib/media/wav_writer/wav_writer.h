//
// This class enables a client to easily create and write LPCM audio data to a
// RIFF-based WAV file. After creating the WavWriter object, Initialize should
// be called before invoking other methods. Following that, the Write method
// is used to instruct the library to append the specified number of bytes to
// the audio file that has been created.  Once the client has completely written
// the file, the client should call Close to update 'length' fields in the file
// and close the file.  If the client wishes, it can also occasionally call
// UpdateHeader, to update the 'length' fields prior to file closure.  These
// calls help maximize the amount of audio data retained, in case of a crash
// before file closure, but at the expense of higher file I/O load.
//
// The method Reset discards any previously-written audio data, and returns the
// file to a state of readiness to be provided audio data.
// By contrast, the Delete method removes the file entirely -- following this
// call, the object generally would be destroyed, although it can be reused by
// again calling Initialize.
//
// Note that this library makes no effort to be thread-safe, so the client bears
// all responsibilities for synchronization.
